2] Converting Equations to System and Solving
3] Roots of Polynomial, using GCD
4] Eigenvalues of a Matrix
5] Newton's Method, One equation
6] Newtons Method, System of Equations
7] Polynomial Approximation, Discrete Data
8] Polynomial Approximation, using Orthogonal Polynomials 
9] Gram Schmidt for Vectors
10] Gram Schmidt for Polynomials
11] Gaussian Formula, based on Orthogonal Polynomials
12] Composite Simpsons Rule for Numerical Integration
13] Composite Trapezoidal Rule for Numerical Integration
14] Infinite Summation
15] Deriving Formulas for Numerical Integration
16] ODEs
17] Runge-Katta
18] PDEs
19] Random Number Generation
20] L/U Decomp
21] Deriving Numerical Differentiation (By Hand)

Note] The code may solve a specific case of a problem, and one must adjust the input to the code. Also, I suggest understanding how to solve the problem analytically, and then following the code.
